# Data Structures and Algorithms Study Log

## Overview

This repository serves as a log for my journey in learning and practicing data structures and algorithms. It is structured around exercises and examples from notable texts in the field, including "Introduction to Algorithms, Fourth Edition" and "Competitive Programming Volumes 1 and 2" by Helix Hamin.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main directories:

- **CP-Volumen1**: Contains chapters and exercises related to Competitive Programming Volume 1.
- **Estructuras_Algoritmos**: Includes exercises and examples focusing on various data structures and algorithms.

Each chapter directory contains problem sets, source code, input/output files, and a dedicated Makefile for compiling and testing the code.
